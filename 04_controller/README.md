This file is very similar to the previous controller test, but the
code is more structured. This time, all four sprits of the banana can
be moved with the controller.

The presses of the controller are saved to a variable by the nmi
and evaluated in the main loop.

If you want to try it, load controller.nes into your favorite
emulator.
