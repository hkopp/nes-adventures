This file prints a banana on the screen consisting of four sprites.
The controllers are read out and the first sprite of the banana can be
moved with the D-pad.
Handling of movement and reading out the controllers is done in the
NMI loop.

If you want to play along, open controller.nes into your favorite
emulator.
